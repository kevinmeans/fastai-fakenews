    "text = \"Federal Reserve officials raised interest rates by a quarter-point on Wednesday in the tenth straight move in their fight against rapid inflation — but they also opened the door to a possible pause in rate increases. Central bankers lifted rates to a range of 5 percent to 5.25 percent, a level they have not reached since the summer of 2007. The move capped the fastest series of rate increases since the 1980s, as the central bank led by Chair Jerome H. Powell attempts to slow the economy and weigh down price increases. Here’s what to know about the central bank’s latest move: In their statement announcing the decision, Fed policymakers indicated that they will watch to see whether future rate moves are necessary. That marks a shift in stance: For months, they had assumed that additional increases would be needed. This opens the door to a possible pause in rate increases. “In determining the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments,” the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee said in its release. The “may” in the statement is a signal that officials are not confident that further moves will absolutely be necessary. In his news conference after the rate announcement, Mr. Powell said that “a decision on a pause was not made today.” He added that “we’ll approach that question at the June meeting,” punting the decision on a potential pause for another month. Investor bets on where interest rates go from here are tilted toward a pause at the Fed’s next meeting and then lower interest rates later in the year. (Mr. Powell said that cutting interest rates this year was “not in our forecast.”) One calculation put the likelihood that the Fed would hold off changing rates when it meets in June at 80 percent. The Fed does not “have an agenda to further consolidate banks,” Mr. Powell said, in response to a question about the seizure and sale of First Republic Bank to JPMorgan Chase, already the country’s largest bank. Mr. Powell said it was a good policy to limit the expansion of the biggest banks, but that exceptions made sense in cases of bank failures. He also said that credit conditions were tightening following the banking turmoil, which could slow the economy. Mr. Powell said it was “essential” that the nation’s debt limit is raised in a timely way. “It’s very important that this be done,” he added, noting that the Fed does not give advice to politicians. The consequences for the U.S. economy of a debt default could be dire, he said. “We shouldn’t even be talking about a world in which the U.S. doesn’t pay its bills,” he said. \"\n",

    "text = \"The United Auto Workers a politically potent labor union is planning to withhold its endorsement of President Biden in the early stages of the 2024 race according to an internal memo from its president to members on Tuesday The memo written by Shawn Fain the Detroitbased unions president said the leadership of the United Auto Workers had traveled to Washington last week to meet with Biden administration officials and had expressed our concerns with the electric vehicle transition that the president has pursued The memo underscores how some of Mr Bidens boldest moves to fight climate change which animate his liberal base could at the same time weaken his political support among another crucial constituency The UAW has shrunk in size in recent decades but it still counts about 400000 active members with a robust presence in Michigan a critical battleground state for Democrats In April the Biden administration proposed the nations most ambitious climate regulations yet which would ensure that twothirds of new passenger cars are allelectric by 2032  up from just 58 percent today The rules if enacted could sharply lower planetwarming pollution from vehicle tailpipes the nations largest source of greenhouse emissions But they come with costs for autoworkers because it takes fewer than half the laborers to assemble an allelectric vehicle as it does to build a gasolinepowered car In the memo Mr Fain provided talking points for members about why the union was not immediately lining up behind Mr Biden writing that if companies received federal subsidies then workers must be compensated with top wages and benefits Whos Running for President in 2024 Card 1 of 10 The race begins Four years after a historically large number of candidates ran for president the field for the 2024 campaign is starting out small and is likely to be headlined by the same two men who ran last time President Biden and Donald Trump Heres who has entered the race so far and who else might run President Biden The president has cast himself as a protector of democracy and a stabilizing force after the upheaval of the Trump administration Biden is running for reelection as the oldest person ever to hold the presidency a subject of concern among many Democrats though the party has publicly set aside those worries and rallied around him Donald Trump The former president is running to retake the office he lost in 2020 Though somewhat diminished in influence within the Republican Party  and facing several legal investigations  he retains a large and committed base of supporters and he could be aided in the primary by multiple challengers splitting a limited antiTrump vote Nikki Haley The former governor of South Carolina and UN ambassador under Trump has presented herself as a member of a new generation of leadership and emphasized her life experience as a daughter of Indian immigrants She was long seen as a rising GOP star but her allure in the party has declined amid her onagain offagain embrace of Trump Asa Hutchinson The former governor of Arkansas is one of a relatively small number of Republicans who have been openly critical of Trump Hutchinson has denounced the former presidents efforts to overturn the 2020 election and said Trump should drop out of the presidential race Marianne Williamson The selfhelp author and former spiritual adviser to Oprah Winfrey is running for a second time In her 2020 campaign the Democrat called for a federal Department of Peace supported reparations for slavery and called Trumpism a symptom of an illness in the American psyche that could not be cured with political policies Vivek Ramaswamy The multimillionaire entrepreneur and author describes himself as antiwoke and is known in rightwing circles for opposing corporate efforts to advance political social and environmental causes He has never held elected office and does not have the name recognition of most other GOP contenders Larry Elder The conservative talk radio host who was a breakout star for the right after running unsuccessfully in Californias recall election in 2021 announced on Tucker Carlsons show on Fox News that he was running for president saying that he had a moral religious and a patriotic duty to give back to a country thats been so good to my family and me Robert Kennedy The Democrat a longtime vaccine skeptic and a member of the Kennedy political dynasty declared that he would challenge President Biden for the Democratic nomination in a longshot bid for the White House Others who might run Gov Ron DeSantis of Florida former Vice President Mike Pence Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina and Gov Chris Sununu of New Hampshire are seen as weighing Republican bids for the White House The EV transition is at serious risk of becoming a race to the bottom the memo reads referring to electric vehicles We want to see national leadership have our back on this before we make any commitments Mr Fain won the UAW presidency as an insurgent candidate this year toppling the incumbent Ray Curry Mr Fain promised a more confrontational path ahead of contract talks In the memo he notes that 150000 autoworkers are fighting for a new contract with the socalled Big Three auto companies in September writing Well stand with whoever stands with our members in that fight Labor support is a key part of Mr Bidens political coalition and his portrayal of himself as a fighter for the middle class Within hours of Mr Bidens formal entry into the 2024 race a number of top labor unions backed Mr Biden including the Amalgamated Transit Union the Service Employees International Union and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Editors Picks Restaurant Review Naro Makes New Magic From Classic Korean Dishes Its the End of a World as We Know It Gordon Lightfoots 10 Essential Songs Several national unions were quick to endorse Mr Fain wrote in his memo The United Auto Workers is not yet making an endorsement Mr Bidens campaign trumpeted his support from other labor unions in a news release Notably Mr Bidens first public appearance after announcing his reelection campaign last week was addressing a labor conference in the nations capital Ive said many times Wall Street didnt build America he told the cheering union crowd last week The middle class built America and unions built the middle class The United Auto Workers which has historically endorsed Democrats and supported Mr Biden in 2020 makes clear in the memo that it has no intent of backing the Republican frontrunner former President Donald J Trump Withholding a formal endorsement for now instead appears to be a bid for leverage or concessions from the administration Another Donald Trump presidency would be a disaster reads Mr Fains memo which was first reported by The Detroit News But our members need to see an alternative that delivers real results We need to get our members organized behind a proworker proclimate and prodemocracy political program that can deliver for the working class Mr Biden has sought to accelerate the transition to allelectric vehicles as a centerpiece of his effort to tackle climate change A 2021 report by the International Energy Agency found that nations would have to stop sales of new gasolinepowered cars by 2035 to avert the deadliest effects of a warming planet To help reach that goal Mr Biden has pushed a fleet of policies designed to promote electric vehicles The Biden administrations proposed climate regulations announced in April are designed to add legal teeth to consumer incentives compelling automakers to manufacture and sell more electric vehicles The Environmental Protection Agency rules however are not yet final They are open for public comment and could still be weakened or otherwise changed before being completed next year As the Biden administration prepared to unveil the new clean car rules last month officials planned for Michael S Regan the head of the EPA to announce the policies in Detroit surrounded by Americanmade allelectric vehicles But as auto executives and the United Auto Workers learned the details of the proposed regulations some grew uneasy about publicly supporting it according to two people familiar with their thinking No one from the United Auto Workers attended the unveiling according to the organizations spokesman although representatives from Ford General Motors and MercedesBenz were there And the setting was moved from Detroit to the EPA headquarters in Washington\"\n",
